# Greedy Lattice Test Code

The goal of this collection of code snippets is to reproduce the results in Kleinberg's 'Navigation in a small world' (2000), generalized to different of shortcuts being generated, as well as to higher dimension lattices.

The Nature Brief Communications pdf is in the folder; the code in `greedy_lattice_test.py` is ~somewhat~ no longer spaghetti-fied at the moment, but is in the process of being flagged for parallelization.
